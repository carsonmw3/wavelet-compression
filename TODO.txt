- Add doctest/testing

- Write different components with int16, int32, or float32 depending on what their coefficients require
	- Normalize coefficients?

- Add support for multiple components in one run

- Class for iterating through component/time/lev/box?

- Split compressor/decompressor

- Ensure everything needed for decompression is written into compressed_dir
